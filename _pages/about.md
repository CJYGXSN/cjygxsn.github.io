I am a third-year Ph.D. Student at the Department of Computer Science, [George Mason University (GMU)](https://www.gmu.edu/), under the supervision of [Prof. Lannan Luo](https://lannan.github.io/index.html) and [Prof. Qiang Zeng](https://cs.gmu.edu/~zeng/index.html). Prior to joining George Mason, I earned a B.S. degree in Computer Science in 2017 from Northeastern University in Shenyang, China, and obtained an M.S. from the University of Melbourne, Australia, in 2020.

My research mainly focuses on IoT Attacks and Defenses. My reserch interests include IoT vulnerability analysis, mobile computing and software engineering.
