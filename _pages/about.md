I am a Postdoc Fellow in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/). I joined the Broadband Communications Research (BBCR) Lab, University of Waterloo, and received the Ph.D. degree under the supervision of Professor [Prof. Xuemin (Sherman) Shen](https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/sshen). Before joining UWaterloo, I received the M.Sc. degree from the University of Illinois Chicago, IL, USA, and the B.Eng degree from Northeastern University in Shenyang, China.

My research interests include space-air-ground integrated networks, network slicing, machine learning in wireless networks, and extended reality.
